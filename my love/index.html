            <p> We met when we were both looking for a new start in life. Our kids were grown and we were both divorced looking to
                start dating. It was a chance encounter that we even met. I went with my friend to visit his cousin, My friend, his cousin and I were all outside talking. A lot of kids were playing, 
                parents fighting and a dog had escaped and some kids were chasing it. Through all the chaos I noticed  her walking by, she looked right at me with those crystal blue eyes and smiled.
                I said hi and she said "Is that the only word you know?"" I responded "No, I didn't know how strong your verbal skills are so I went with simple." We laughed and exchanged some more banter and ended up talking 
                for the next few hours. I had never felt so attracted to someone before and not just her appearance but that sexy brain. We connected on a new level for me.
                She was implanted in my brain and I would find out later that I was implanted in hers. From that day we seen each other everyday and a month after that we never left each others side.
                We started a cleaning business and got a contract cleaning all state funded daycare facilities in our city. We held this contract for 2 years until Jenna got deathly sick.

            <p> Jenna was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis which is an autoimmune disease that tells your white bloodcells to attack your joints. During this same time my health started to decline as well. I started to have intense seizures and had to be induced into a coma for a week til my seizures stopped.
                We were both in and out of the hospital over the next few years. During this time of recovery for both of us we had our appartment burn to the ground and lost everything. We were managing a bar near downtown Denver.  She was running the bar and I was going to take a nap but she wanted me to stay and hang out.
                 A few hour later we get a call from our neighbor that building had burned down. I thought it was a joke until I got a call from police department. I believe she saved my life that day, I would have been sleeping and burned up in the fire if she didn't ask me to stay. I don't know why I stayed because I was really tired and had a seizure that morning.
                 I stayed because she wanted me by her side and we had gone through so much together that if one of us needed the other we were there. All this tragedy and it didn't seem that bad because we had each other. Our bond grew stronger and our trust became unbreakable.

            <p>Jenna is now my wife and I wouldn't trade her for anything in this life or the next. We love each other without judgement, I don't want her to change
                and she doesn't want to change me. I want to grow old with her and listen to her come backs from my sarcasm. Out of the billions of people on this planet she is the perfect one for me. 
                what are the odds of that? I guess it is has same odds as our chance encounter when we met! What I'm trying to say is any interaction could lead to something bigger,be on the lookout.
